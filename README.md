<h1>Personal Habit Tracker</h1>

This Python script is designed to interact with the Pixela API to help you track your daily habits or activities over time. Pixela is a simple and customizable habit-tracking service that allows you to create graphs and record data points for each habit.

The project was done as part of the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) - Day 37.
